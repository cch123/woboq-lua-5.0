<doc f='include/readline/readline.h' l='720'>/* If non-zero, this is the address of a function to call when reading
   directory entries from the filesystem for completion and comparing
   them to the partial word to be completed.  The function should
   either return its first argument (if no conversion takes place) or
   newly-allocated memory.  This can, for instance, convert filenames
   between character sets for comparison against what&apos;s typed at the
   keyboard.  The returned value is what is added to the list of
   matches.  The second argument is the length of the filename to be
   converted. */</doc>
