   completing a word would normally display the list of possible matches.
   This function is called instead of actually doing the display.
   It takes three arguments: (char **matches, int num_matches, int max_length)
   where MATCHES is the array of strings that matched, NUM_MATCHES is the
   number of strings in that array, and MAX_LENGTH is the length of the
   longest string in that array. */</doc>
