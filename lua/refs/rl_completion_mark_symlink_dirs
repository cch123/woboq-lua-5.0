<doc f='include/readline/readline.h' l='812'>/* If non-zero, a slash will be appended to completed filenames that are
   symbolic links to directory names, subject to the value of the
   mark-directories variable (which is user-settable).  This exists so
   that application completion functions can override the user&apos;s preference
   (set via the mark-symlinked-directories variable) if appropriate.
   It&apos;s set to the value of _rl_complete_mark_symlink_dirs in
   rl_complete_internal before any application-specific completion
   function is called, so without that function doing anything, the user&apos;s
   preferences are honored. */</doc>
