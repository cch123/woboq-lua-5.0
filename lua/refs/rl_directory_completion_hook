   completing on a directory name.  The function is called with
   the address of a string (the current directory name) as an arg.  It
   changes what is displayed when the possible completions are printed
   or inserted.  The directory completion hook should perform
   any necessary dequoting.  This function should return 1 if it modifies
   the directory name pointer passed as an argument.  If the directory
   completion hook returns 0, it should not modify the directory name
   pointer passed as an argument. */</doc>
